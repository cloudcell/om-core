"""
CommandService — thin bus-side adapter for command execution.

Phase 5: MessageBus command transport.

This is not a semantic command engine. It is a transport boundary that:
1. subscribes to the unified command ingress topic `request.command`;
2. validates envelope/session shape;
3. delegates execution to `CommandExecutor.execute(...)`;
4. packages the returned `ExecutionResult` as a reply envelope;
5. never contains command-specific business logic.
