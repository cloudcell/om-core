"""Event Bus for command lifecycle events.

Provides a centralized publish/subscribe system for command execution events.
All communication between major subsystems flows through the Event Bus.

Event naming convention:
- command.<id>.before → Specific command before (e.g., command.set.before)
- command.<id>.succeeded → Specific command succeeded
- command.<id>.failed  → Specific command failed

Wildcard subscription patterns:
- command.*.before    → matches all command pre-execution events
- command.*.succeeded → matches all command success events
- command.*.failed    → matches all command failure events
- * matches exactly one dot-delimited segment
